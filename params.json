{"name":"PuppetTrack","tagline":"kinect v2 based object tracking system","body":"### Welcome to huangchaodian Pages.\r\nwe present an speech rehabilitation training system based on kinect2.0.Instead of tracking skeleton,we proposed a system tracking the motion of the user’s familiar rigid toys,props,and puppets.The user can manipulates these objects directly in front of an inexpensive Kinect 2.0 depth camera and our system renders the corresponding 3D models into a virtual set in real-time.However the user may lack of fine motor skills,the object size matters to them more than normal children.It is thus vary important to chose a suitable size of a tangible objects such that it can be grabbed with ease[TUI..],which sometimes means vary small.The small size objects challenge the real-time tracking system in several aspects.First of all,raw data size of the object to be tracked captured by Kinect2.0 will also be small(sometime less then 200 points),which make it hard for the algorithm to use a local feature extract method(i.e,SIFT).Also the data is noisy,the algorithm must be robust to the noise data. Our method overcomes these challenge and run in real time.\r\n\r\n### Realtime Object Tracking Based on kinect 2.0 video\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
